What to expect from downloading this:
	The features:
		We have many features including a Docker Installation
		We have many checks to make sure you won't have any potential issues and prevent Errors
		We will try to fix all problem that happened to you by submitting a Issue and We will answer as fast as possible!
	
	Required Dependencies are of the following:
		git -- sudo apt install git

	When you download it from the repository, you must first enter the directory you have in then run the file as 'source freqtrade.sh' and this should install it properly and place you in a correct directory
	however, this is not what the original creators of freqtrade might want. We recommend you to go to https://www.freqtrade.io and read documentation. I am just a developer that wants to make other lives more easy and convenient
	As of now, installing through docker has been tested thoroughly however please everyone understand that this software is still WIP (Work In Progress) and the software will change as new features get implemented and old buggy features get deprecated

Thank you for downloading the installer

Sincerely, FreeSDE

This version is ubuntu only! Do not install with this software on a different OS

Disclaimer: This is not official software, we don't own freqtrade or freqtrade.io. Your installation might vary version to version and if you find a problem, make sure to submit the problem to the issue tab on the repository. We'll try to fix them
