What to expect from downloading this:

Firstly, you have to install git. As of now, the script is unable to check for dependencies. However, we will create more capabilities as we speak

When you download it from the repositry, you must first enter the directory you have in then run the file as 'source freqtrade.sh' and this should install it properly and place you in a correct directory
however, this isn't a fool proof solution. We recommend you to go to https://www.freqtrade.io and read documentation. I am just a developer that wants to make other lives more easy and convenient
As of now, installing through docker is not a viable option.

Thank you for downloading the installer

Sincerely, The Owner


Disclaimer: This is not official software, we don't own freqtrade or freqtrade.io. Your installation might vary version to version and if you find a problem, make sure to report the problem to the repository. I'll fix them accordly
