What to expect from downloading this:

Firstly, you have to install git. We have many checks to make sure you won't have any potential issues

When you download it from the repositry, you must first enter the directory you have in then run the file as 'source freqtrade.sh' and this should install it properly and place you in a correct directory
however, this isn't a fool proof solution. We recommend you to go to https://www.freqtrade.io and read documentation. I am just a developer that wants to make other lives more easy and convenient
As of now, installing through docker is not a viable option.

Thank you for downloading the installer

Sincerely, FreeSDE

This is version is ubuntu only! Do not install with this software on a different OS

Disclaimer: This is not official software, we don't own freqtrade or freqtrade.io. Your installation might vary version to version and if you find a problem, make sure to report the problem to the repository. We'll try to fix them
