What to expect from downloading this:

Firstly, you have to install git. As of now, the script is unable to check for dependencies. However, we will create more capabilities as we speak

When you download it from the repositry this file, you must first enter the directory you have in then run the file as 'source freqtrade.sh' and this should install it properly and place you in a correct directory
however, this isn't a fool proof solution. We recommend you to go to https://freqtrade.io and read documentation. I am just a developer that wants to make other lives more easy and convenient
As of now, installing through docker is not a viable option.

Thank you for downloading the installer

Sincerely, FreeSDE
